//! Harness API wiring for desktop2.
//!
//! Connects to the harness API socket (served by `jcode-harness-api-bridge`)
//! on a background thread, attaches a session, and forwards streamed events
//! to the UI thread over a channel.
//!
//! The app starts the runtime it needs rather than telling the user to. A
//! desktop app that only works when you have already launched two daemons by
//! hand is indistinguishable from a broken one, so `ensure_runtime` boots the
//! jcode daemon and the bridge on demand and waits for the socket.
